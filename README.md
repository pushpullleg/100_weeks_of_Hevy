# 🏋️‍♀️ Workout Analytics Dashboard
A 100-week analysis of personal workout data using Power BI to uncover trends in workout frequency, time commitment, and goal consistency through clean, interactive dashboards.

## 📂 Project Contents
- **Hevy_workouts_log_100_weeks.csv** – Cleaned dataset of 100 weeks of exercise logs.
- **Workout_Analytics.pbix** – Power BI dashboard file with all visualizations.

## How to View
Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore all visuals interactively

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
### Workout Consistency Gauge
A gauge visual shows how often the 4-workouts-per-week goal was met. Achieved: 84% vs. Target: 95%.

### Workout Duration Breakdown
A Funnel visual displaying how many days workouts lasted under 30 min, between 30–45 min, and over 45 min.

### Workout Trends
Line charts depicting huors worked, max weight lifted over time, reflecting patterns, plateaus, or spikes.

### Calendar Heatmap
Built a calendar heatmap using Python (Pandas). Days are color-coded by workout intensity (darker = more sets).

### Data De-duplication Logic
The dataset originally logged exercises not sessions, so care was taken to avoid overcounting workouts. Duplicate logs under the same session ID are consolidated to count as one workout.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
Over 80% of workouts lasted more than 45 minutes — reflecting strong time commitment and planning.
