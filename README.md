# 🏋️‍♀️ Workout Analytics Dashboard
This project explores personal workout trends over a 100-week period using Power BI. The goal was to understand workout patterns, time commitment, and goal consistency through visually appealing and insightful dashboards.

## 📂 Project Contents
Hevy_workouts_log_100_weeks.csv — Cleaned dataset of exercise logs across 100 weeks.

Workout_Analytics.pbix — Power BI dashboard file containing multiple visualizations.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
### Workout Consistency Gauge
A gauge visual shows how often the 4-workouts-per-week goal was met. Achieved: 84% vs. Target: 95%.

### Workout Duration Breakdown
Multi-row card visual displaying how many days workouts lasted under 30 min, between 30–45 min, and over 45 min.

### Weekly Workout Trends
Bar charts and line visuals depict workout volume over time, reflecting patterns, plateaus, or spikes.

### Data De-duplication Logic
The dataset originally logged exercises not sessions, so care was taken to avoid overcounting workouts. Duplicate logs under the same session ID are consolidated to count as one workout.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
Over 80% of workouts lasted more than 45 minutes — reflecting strong time commitment and planning.

The 84% goal achievement rate demonstrates discipline, even when the initial target was ambitious.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and transformation (Power Query)
- Data modeling to deduplicate exercise logs
- Dashboard design in Power BI
- KPI visualizations (Gauge, Multi-Row Cards, Custom Tooltips)
